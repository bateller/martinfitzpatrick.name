So, for some unknown reason I recently thought it might be good to start 
putting together some video tutorials for Python.  I thought I'd start with 
something I was sure I knew a fair bit about: writing GUI applications with 
PyQt (+PySide).

It turned out to be a lot more work than I thought, but rewarding to get the
finished product. Like most programming tutorials it is predominantly screencast
based, but I've included short lecture-like segments in each part to get
across the key points. For those interested in such things, the setup I used was —

* Screen recording - ScreenFlow (Mac)
* Microphone - Samson GO Mic USB
* Audio editing - Audacity

For hosting the course I thought I'd try out Udemy. The list price is $35
but if you're reading this [you can have it for free](https://www.udemy.com/create-simple-gui-applications-with-python-and-qt/?couponCode=BLOG2015). Simultaneously I'm
hosting free previews of the lectures on YouTube to see how it all works out. I don't
expect to get rich from this, but pennies in the pot doesn't hurt.

The course is built around communicating the basics needed to get up and running, and then moves on to create a demo application — a tabbed web browser — in PyQt.

Since it's my first attempt at doing this I'm more interested in getting 
good solid feedback on — 

* Is it any good?
* How can I improve it.  

I would also be interested to hear your thoughts on Udemy as a platform - both
on course quality and value for money. It's obvious that the pricing
strategy there is price high and discount hard which seems a bit disingenuous.
But there is no arguing with the audience that it brings. 

So [sign up for the course](https://www.udemy.com/create-simple-gui-applications-with-python-and-qt/?couponCode=BLOG2015)
and let me know what you think, in either a review, a message or the comments.
