Open a terminal window to perform the installation (`Ctrl-Alt-T`) then enter the following at the prompt:



    :::bash

    wget http://dl.google.com/dl/earth/client/current/google-earth-stable_current_i386.deb



You will see a progress bar as the download completes. This is a perfect time for a cup of tea.


>For 64bit architecture use:

>

>    :::bash

>    wget http://dl.google.com/dl/earth/client/current/google-earth-stable_current_amd64.deb

>

>And change the filename in the subsequent commands.


Next install the downloaded `.deb` package:



    :::bash

    sudo dpkg -i google-earth-stable_current_i386.deb




>If you get errors with this command due to missing dependencies you can 'force' install of Google Earth and missing dependencies with `sudo apt-get install -f`

>


You should now have a fully functional Google Earth!
