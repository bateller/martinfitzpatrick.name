CDPATH is an environment variable which tells the `cd` command where to look for the specified folder. By including the parent folders of commonly used locations you can access folders more easily - and without typing an entire path.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->







Open up your shell profile file `.bashrc` (Linux) or `.bash_profile` (Mac).



Somewhere near the bottom of the file add a line to set the CDPATH environment variable:



`CDPATH=:..:~:~/data:~/projects`



In order left to right this tells `cd` to look in:



1. The current directory (blank; before the first `:`)

2. The parent directory `..`

3. Your home directory `~`

4. Your projects directory in your home `~/projects`




>You can add as many folders to search as you like and these will be checked in order from left to right.


Restart your shell (close and reopen or enter `restart`) and then try to `cd` to folders in your home directory from anywhere on your filesystem with `cd <foldername>` and no path.
