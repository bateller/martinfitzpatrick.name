Title: Creating a Udemy course
Slug: creating-a-udemy-course
Status: draft

After coming across the [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com) platform, I thought I would have a go at creating 
some video tutorials. Since it was the first time attempting this I started with something I knew a 
fair bit about: writing GUI applications with PyQt (+PySide).

Below I give a brief overview of the setup I used in case you feel like 
doing the same thing yourself.

If you're just looking to sign up for the course, the list price is $35 but [if you're reading this you can get it for $9](https://www.udemy.com/create-simple-gui-applications-with-python-and-qt/?couponCode=BLOG9). There is also a 
[subset of the lectures on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7mapoMMlatoa2GFxoNNKU0CC9sBdsTuy) which will be extended with more free content as the main course grows.

## General

Since it was the first time creating an online course I was starting from scratch, with
both the equipment and software. I made those decisions based on online reviews and am 
completely happy with the results, particularly considering I spent relatively little on it.

The basic outline of the equipment is as follows —

* Screen recording - ScreenFlow (Mac)
* Microphone - Samson GO Mic USB
* Audio editing - Audacity

Optional extras —

* Pop filter
* Microphone stand
* Webcam 

# Video


### Update 2016.01.16

Udemy makes a big thing out of you putting your glorious mug in your videos to make yourself
seem more human. I've got a perfectly decent webcam on my Mac, but since it now lives closed
up in a dock it's not much use. To make it possible to record video and/or start doing live
one-to-one support, I've purchased a Logitech C920e Pro webcam.

Despite what you can read all, over, the, web, this thing actually works perfectly find with
MacOS X (at least El Capitan) and the video quality is excellent.

## Audio

I chose the Samson GO Mic USB on the basis of online reviews, where it's consistently referred
to as being *good quality, especially for the price*. Initially I was recording with it clipped
to a laptop, and later holding it, which it performs perfectly well.


There are three volume input settings on the microphone — cardoid, and -10dB which all 
work well and allow control for different types of recording. 
The -10dB setting is preferable for recording voice to cut out background noise 
(particularly I live near a busy road) it requires you to  speak very close to the microphone which 
results in audible breath and pop noises. This meant for a lot more time spent in editing to
cut this out, without leaving audible 'holes'. 

### Update 2016.01.16

I've since purchased a microphone stand and pop filter. The stand seems to help with isolating
the microphone from the nearby road noise, while adding the pop filter allows the microphone to
be used up close with the audio gain turned to -10dB. With this I am now able to record 
audio next to a main road, without picking up traffic noise or noise.


## Editing


## Finally

I would also be interested to hear your thoughts on Udemy as a platform - both
on course quality and value for money. It's obvious that the pricing
strategy there is price high and discount hard which seems a bit disingenuous.
But there is no arguing with the audience that it brings.
