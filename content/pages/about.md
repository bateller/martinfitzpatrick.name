Title: About
Slug: about

I am a final-year PhD student working on the metabolomics of inflammatory diseases. 
To do this I combine metabolomic techniques, such as NMR, with cytokine expression and other assays to determine the function, importance and stability of metabolism in inflammatory diseases.

Parallel to laboratory research, I've developed a number of software tools to 
speed up the process of analysis interpretation of metabolomic data within a pathway context and interact with data from different sources. My published software is open source and available [here][software].

Born in [Leeds](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/Leeds,+West+Yorkshire,+UK/), I've lived in [Barnoldswick](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/Barnoldswick,+Lancashire,+UK/), [York](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/York,+UK/), [Edinburgh](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/Edinburgh,+City+of+Edinburgh,+UK/) and [Birmingham](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/Birmingham,+West+Midlands,+UK/), United Kingdom. 
I'm now living in [Utrecht](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/Utrecht,+Utrecht,+Netherlands/) in the Netherlands, working in
the [Heck Lab](http://hecklab.com/) at [Universiteit Utrecht](http://www.uu.nl).

I enjoy playing squash poorly and eating and drinking well. I also like a good hike, but don't do it as often as I like. I walked the [West Highland Way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Highland_Way) in 1998 and 2013. It doesn't get easier with age.

Ik spreek een beetje Nederlands.

### What's all this then?

On this site you'll find details of my publications and software, together with articles
relating to how to make use of one or the other. There are also a number of historic protocols collected from around the web that I've collated and fixed up with their original author's permission.
