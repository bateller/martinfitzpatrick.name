Title: About
Slug: about

I am a postdoctoral researcher in proteomics, using Python and other tools to 
analyse large proteomic datasets and developing scientific software to simplify the 
process of data analysis. A self-taught programmer with over 25 years experience dating back to the days of the
ZX Spectrum and [Sam Coupé](/tag/samcoupe). I code most happily in [Python](/tag/python) but am also 
familiar with C, MATLAB, [Pascal](/tag/pascal), Perl, PHP, Prolog, R,
Spectrum/[Sam BASIC](/tag/samcoupe) and z80 ASM.

Born in [Leeds](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/Leeds,+West+Yorkshire,+UK/), I've lived in [Barnoldswick](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/Barnoldswick,+Lancashire,+UK/), [York](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/York,+UK/), [Edinburgh](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/Edinburgh,+City+of+Edinburgh,+UK/) and [Birmingham](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/Birmingham,+West+Midlands,+UK/), United Kingdom. 
I'm now living in [Utrecht](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview/place/Utrecht,+Utrecht,+Netherlands/) in the Netherlands, working in
the [Heck Lab](http://hecklab.com/) at [Universiteit Utrecht](http://www.uu.nl). Ik spreek een beetje Nederlands.

I enjoy playing squash poorly and eating and drinking well. I also like a good hike, but don't do it often enough.
I walked the [West Highland Way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Highland_Way) in 1998 and 2013 — it didn't get easier with age.

On this site you'll find all sorts of code, software, tutorials and articles. Some interesting
tags to get you started — [Python](/tag/python), [Pathomx](/tag/pathomx) and [Sam Coupé](/tag/samcoupe).
