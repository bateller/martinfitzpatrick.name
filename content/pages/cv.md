A self-taught programmer with over 25 years experience dating back to the days of the
ZX Spectrum and [Sam Coupé](/tag/samcoupe). After dabbling in IT, I took a 7 year detour into biology, 
completing a Medical Science (BMedSc) degree, masters (MRes) and PhD in the metabolomics 
of inflammatory diseases, where I found myself using code to solve analysis problems. 
I had unexpectedly become a “bioinformatician”.

I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher in proteomics & bioinformatics, using Python 
and other tools to analyse large proteomic datasets and developing scientific software to 
simplify the process of data analysis.

I code happily in [Python](/tag/python) and with regret in R and MATLAB. I'm also familiar with a long 
list of languages that I have learnt along the way including C, 
[Pascal](/tag/pascal), Perl, PHP, Prolog, [Sam BASIC](/tag/samcoupe) and z80 ASM.
