A self-taught programmer with over 25 years experience dating back to the days of the
ZX Spectrum and [Sam Coupé](). After dabbling in IT, I took a 7 year detour into biology, 
completing a Medical Science (BMedSc) degree, masters (MRes) and PhD in the metabolomics 
of inflammatory diseases, where I found myself using code to solve analysis problems. 
I had unexpectedly become a “bioinformatician”.

I now work as a postdoctoral researcher in proteomics, using Python and other tools to 
analyse large proteomic datasets and developing scientific software to simplify the 
process of data analysis.

I code happily in Python and with regret in R and MATLAB. I'm also familiar with a long 
list of languages that I have learnt and then subsequently forgotten including C, 
[Pascal](), Perl, PHP, Prolog, Spectrum/[Sam BASIC]() and z80 ASM.
