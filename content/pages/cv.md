## Current Research Focus: The role of metabolism in inflammation and resolution.

 Using an in vitro macrophage model we have successfully determined characteristic metabolic profiles associated with differentiated macrophage subsets. By exposing these cells to different environmental stimuli, including hypoxia, variations in pH and metabolite concentrations, we hope to determine the extent to which inflammatory cells are influenced metabolically by their environment. This may have particular relevance in chronic inflammatory diseases where distinct local environments are constructed by the influx of immune cells. Analysis and interpretation of metabolomic data sets has been simplified through the development of a novel software package MetaPath that allows visualisations of metabolic changes within a pathway context. We have successfully applied this software in vivo looking at local metabolic changes in renal vasculitis.
