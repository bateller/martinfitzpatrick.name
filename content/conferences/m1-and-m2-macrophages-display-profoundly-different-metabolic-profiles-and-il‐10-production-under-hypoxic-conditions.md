**Background:** Macrophages have a wide range of immunological and
non-immunological functions, ranging from clearance of apoptotic cells,
tissue remodelling, and release of pro and anti-inflammatory mediators
at sites of tissue damage or infection. Subsets of phenoty- pically
distinct macrophages may be uniquely adapted to perform these roles.
Phenotypically and functionally distinguishable monocyte-de- rived cell
lines also express unique metabolic profiles, suggesting that metabolism
may have the potential to regulate function.

**Methods:** In order to
determine whether differentiated macrophages display similar profound
metabolic differences, and whether these differences affect function, we
differentiated primary human blood monocytes under a range of
oxygenation conditions and assessed their metabolic fingerprints using
NMR spectroscopy. Results: Significant differences were seen in the
metabolic profiles of M1 versus. M2 macrophages undergoing
differentiation, with M1s displaying much reduced lactate levels, and
corresponding increases in glucose, suggestive of gluconeogenesis via
putative PFKFB3 (fructose- 1,6-bisphosphatase) activity. M1s were
demonstrated to be constitu- tively active under oxygen reperfusion
conditions, with no corre- sponding metabolic changes following LPS
stimulation. M2s, in contrast, showed an expected hypoxia profile of
increased lactate levels under differentiation, and remained inactive in
reperfusion conditions. However, production of IL-10 following LPS
stimulation was shown to be significantly reduced in hypoxic conditions.

**Conclusion:** A model of permissive inflammation during M1 infiltration
under hypoxia may be suggested. In normal tissues reperfusion and
reduced recruitment may therefore drive resolution aberrant recruitment
of M1 macrophages or persitent tissue hypoxia may result in chronic
inflammation such as that seen in the rheumatoid synovium.
