**Background:** Macrophages are abundant in the synovium of RA and are the
major source of many inflammatory cytokines, including TNFÎ±. Disease
severity correlates strongly with both synovial macrophage abundance and
activation status but inversely with oxygen levels. Given the importance
of oxygen to cell metabolism, differentiation and function, we
hypothesized that the unique metabolic and oxygen environment of the
joint may drive the differentiation of aggressive macrophages.

**Methods:** Human monocytes were differentiated into macrophage subsets (M1
and M2c) under GM-CSF and M-CSF polarizing conditions and under a
variety of oxygen conditions, and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). Cell metabolites were extracted for metabolomic analysis using
NMR spectroscopy and secreted cytokines assessed. NMR spectra were
analysed using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to
build models describing differences in metabolites, and partial least
squares regression (PLS-R) to correlate these to cytokine production.
Metabolites differentiating between experimental groups and pathways
were identified and analysed using bespoke metabolic analysis tools.

**Results:** Macrophage subtypes exhibited unique metabolic patterns that,
while shifting during differentiation, remained distinct throughout
stimulation and subsequent activation with LPS. Differentiation of
monocytes to both M1 and M2c macrophages increased production of
myo-inositol, a marker of calcium signaling, and the proteinogenic amino
acid serine. These correlated strongly with LPS-induced IL-6 production.
M2c macrophages showed increased arginine production which correlated
with IL-10 production, a key M2c anti-inflammatory cytokine. M1
macrophages exhibited higher glycolytic flux and a reduction in citric
acid cycle metabolites.

Differentiation under hypoxia gave an altered metabolic phenotype, with
a reduced citric acid cycle, and increased glycolytic flux. However,
both M1 and M2c subsets remained metabolically distinct. Strikingly,
differentiation of both M1 and M2c macrophages under reperfusion
conditions resulted in an activated metabolic profile, indistinguishable
from that induced by LPS, but interestingly up-regulation of IL-6 was
not seen.

**Conclusions:** Classically-activated M1 macrophages and regulatory M2c
macrophages each possess a unique metabotype that, while altered by
environmental stressors, remains unique to the cell. This stability may
depend on tight regulation at the gene and protein level, and we suggest
that this is closely coupled to the macrophage differentiation
programme. The increased arginine in M2c, for example, suggests a
down-regulation of the arginase pathway in this resolution-associated
subset. Therefore, while a capacity to adapt to the environment clearly
remains, differentiation constrains this. We propose that this may
impair subset survival or function in abnormal environments such as the
rheumatoid synovium.
