Epstein-Barr virus is a γ-herpesvirus endemic (>90%) in the human
population and implicated in a variety of lymphomas and solid tumours
including Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma and post-transplant
lymphoproliferative disorder. Despite the prevalence of EBV, little is
known about the mechanisms of early infection, including the role of the
various membrane glycoproteins to entry, fusion and escape.
Additionally, although the long term immune response is well
characterised, the contribution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell recognition to
surveillance of primary cellular infection is not known. In order to
further understand the processes of virus entry and processing we have
used a panel of glycoprotein knockout viruses and viral epitope-specific
CD4+ CD8+ T cell clones to study EBV infection of primary B cells. We
have shown that following binding uptake is rapid yet selective, with
suggested roles for gp42 and gp85 in attachment and initiation of
fusion. Endocytosis results in rapid up-regulation of primary resting B
cell endosomal activity, although no further surface-bound EBV is
internalised. Endosomal trafficking of endocytosed virus is rapid,
reaching the late endosomal compartment within the first hour, and
subsequent HLA class II loading and presentation within 8 hours of
binding. Further, both membrane and capsid proteins were seen in the
late endosome by confocal, indicating relatively low fusion efficiency.
The endocytic/HLA class II pathway may therefore offer a promising
target for CD4+ T cell immunotherapy offering a first line of defence
during de novo infection.
