Epstein-Barr virus, a B-lymphotropic herpesvirus, is the cause of
infectious mononucleosis, has strong aetiologic links with several
malignancies and has been implicated in certain autoimmune diseases.
Efforts to develop a prophylactic vaccine to prevent or reduce
EBV-associated disease have, to date, focused on the induction of
neutralising antibody responses. However, such vaccines might be further
improved by inducing T cell responses capable of recognising and killing
recently-infected B cells. In that context, EBNA2, EBNA-LP and BHRF1 are
the first viral antigens expressed during the initial stage of B cell
growth transformation, yet have been poorly characterised as CD8+ T cell
targets. Here we describe CD8+ T cell responses against each of these
three "first wave" proteins, identifying target epitopes and HLA
restricting alleles. While EBNA-LP and BHRF1 each contained one strong
CD8 epitope, epitopes within EBNA2 induced immunodominant responses
through several less common HLA class I alleles (e.g. B*3801 and
B*5501), as well as subdominant responses through common class I alleles
(e.g. B7 and C*0304). Importantly, such EBNA2-specific CD8+ T cells
recognised B cells within the first day post-infection, prior to CD8+ T
cells against well-characterised latent target antigens such as EBNA3B
or LMP2, and effectively inhibited outgrowth of EBV-transformed B cell
lines. We infer that "first wave" antigens of the growth-transforming
infection, especially EBNA2, constitute potential CD8+ T cell immunogens
for inclusion in prophylactic EBV vaccine design.
