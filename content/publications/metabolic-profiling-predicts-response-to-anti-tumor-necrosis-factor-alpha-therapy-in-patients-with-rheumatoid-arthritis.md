**OBJECTIVE:** Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies are highly effective in
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), but a
significant number of patients exhibit only a partial or no therapeutic
response. Inflammation alters local and systemic metabolism, and TNF
plays a role in this. We undertook this study to determine if the
patient's metabolic fingerprint prior to therapy could predict responses
to anti-TNF agents. 

**METHODS:** Urine was collected from 16 RA patients and 20 PsA patients before and
during therapy with infliximab or etanercept. Urine metabolic profiles
were assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Discriminating metabolites were identified, and the relationship between
metabolic profiles and clinical outcomes was assessed.

**RESULTS:** Baseline urine metabolic profiles discriminated between RA patients who
did or did not have a good response to anti-TNF therapy according to
European League Against Rheumatism criteria, with a sensitivity of 88.9%
and a specificity of 85.7%, with several metabolites contributing (in
particular histamine, glutamine, xanthurenic acid, and ethanolamine).
There was a correlation between baseline metabolic profiles and the
magnitude of change in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints from
baseline to 12 months in RA patients (P = 0.04). In both RA and PsA,
urinary metabolic profiles changed between baseline and 12 weeks of
anti-TNF therapy. Within the responders, urinary metabolite changes
distinguished between etanercept and infliximab treatment.

**CONCLUSION:** The clear relationship between urine metabolic profiles of RA patients
at baseline and their response to anti-TNF therapy may allow development
of novel approaches to the optimization of therapy. Differences in
metabolic profiles during treatment with infliximab and etanercept in RA
and PsA may reflect distinct mechanisms of action.
