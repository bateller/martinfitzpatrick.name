**Background** Metabolomics is a systems approach to the analysis of
cellular processes through small-molecule metabolite profiling.
Standardisation of sample handling and acquisition approaches has
contributed to reproducibility. However, the development of robust
methods for the analysis of metabolomic data is a work-in-progress. The
tools that do exist are often not well integrated, requiring manual data
handling and custom scripting on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore,
existing tools often require experience with programming environments
such as MATLAB® or R to use, limiting accessibility. Here we present
Pathomx, a workflow-based tool for the processing, analysis and
visualisation of metabolomic and associated data in an intuitive and
extensible environment.

**Results** The core application provides a workflow editor, IPython
kernel and a HumanCyc™-derived database of metabolites, proteins and
genes. Toolkits provide reusable tools that may be linked together to
create complex workflows. Pathomx is released with a base set of plugins
for the import, processing and visualisation of data. The IPython
backend provides integration with existing platforms including MATLAB®
and R, allowing data to be seamlessly transferred. Pathomx is supplied
with a series of demonstration workflows and datasets. To demonstrate
the use of the software we here present an analysis of 1D and 2D 1H NMR
metabolomic data from a model system of mammalian cell growth under
hypoxic conditions.

**Conclusions** Pathomx is a useful addition to the analysis toolbox.
The intuitive interface lowers the barrier to entry for non-experts,
while scriptable tools and integration with existing tools supports
complex analysis. We welcome contributions from the community.
