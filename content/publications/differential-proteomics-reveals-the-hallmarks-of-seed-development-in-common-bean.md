Common bean (*Phaseolus vulgaris L.*) is one of the most consumed staple
foods worldwide. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms
controlling seed development. This study aims to comprehensively
describe proteome dynamics during seed development of common bean. A
high-throughput gel-free proteomics approach (LC–MS/MS) was conducted on
seeds at 10, 20, 30 and 40 days after anthesis, spanning from late
embryogenesis until desiccation. Of the 418 differentially accumulated
proteins identified, 255 were characterized, most belonging to protein
metabolism. An accumulation of proteins belonging to the MapMan
functional categories of “protein”, “glycolysis”, “TCA”, “DNA”, “RNA”,
“cell” and “stress” were found at early seed development stages,
reflecting an extensive metabolic activity. In the mid stages,
accumulation of storage, signaling, starch synthesis and cell
wall-related proteins stood out. In the later stages, an increase in
proteins related to redox, protein degradation/modification/folding and
nucleic acid metabolisms reflect that seed desiccation-resistance
mechanisms were activated. Our study unveils new clues to understand the
regulation of seed development mediated by post-translational
modifications and maintenance of genome integrity. This knowledge
enhances the understanding on seed development molecular mechanisms that
may be used in the design and selection of common bean seeds with
desired quality traits.
