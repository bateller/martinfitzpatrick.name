Macrophages have a wide range of immunological and non-immunological
functions in the host, ranging from clearance of apoptotic cells, tissue
remodelling, and release of pro and anti-inflammatory mediators at site
of tissue damage or infection. Within these wide-ranging functions
however, subsets of macrophages show unique phenotypic adaptations to
their role. Studies on monocyte-derived cell lines have shown that these
phenotypic differences are matched by underlying metabolic signatures,
with the potential to have profound effects on cell capabilities. In
order to determine whether differentiated macrophages displayed similar
profound metabolic profiles, and whether these differences affect
function, we differentiated primary blood monocytes under a range of
culture oxygenation conditions. Initial results show significant
differences in the metabolic profiles of M1 vs. M2 macrophages
undergoing differentiation, with M1s displaying much reduced lactate
levels, and corresponding increases in glucose suggestive of
gluconeogenesis via putative PFKFB3 (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase)
activity. M1s were demonstrated to be constitutively active under
reperfusion conditions, with no corresponding metabolic changes
following LPS stimulation. M2s, in contrast, showed an expected hypoxia
profile of increased lactate levels under differentiation, and remained
inactive in reperfusion conditions, however production of IL-10
following LPS stimulation was shown to be significantly reduced in
hypoxic conditions. A model of permissive inflammation during M1
infiltration and under hypoxia is suggested, with reperfusion and
reduced recruitment driving resolution in normal tissues. However, in
persistently hypoxic tissues or regions of aberrant recruitment and
proliferation, the potential exists for differentiating macrophages to
drive and maintain a chronic inflammatory state.
