*Metabolomics in the Analysis of Inflammatory Diseases* is chapter 
[11](http://www.intechopen.com/books/metabolomics/metabolomics-in-the-analysis-of-inflammatory-diseases) in the open-access book
[Metabolomics](http://www.intechopen.com/books/metabolomics) edited by 
[Ute Roessner](http://www.intechopen.com/books/editor/metabolomics).

Metabolomics is a rapidly emerging field in life sciences, which aims to
identify and quantify metabolites in a biological system. Analytical
chemistry is combined with sophisticated informatics and statistics
tools to determine and understand metabolic changes upon genetic or
environmental perturbations. Together with other 'omics analyses, such
as genomics and proteomics, metabolomics plays an important role in
functional genomics and systems biology studies in any biological
science. This book will provide the reader with summaries of the
state-of-the-art of technologies and methodologies, especially in the
data analysis and interpretation approaches, as well as give insights
into exciting applications of metabolomics in human health studies,
safety assessments, and plant and microbial research.
