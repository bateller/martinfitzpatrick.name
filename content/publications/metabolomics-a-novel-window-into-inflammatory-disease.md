Inflammation is an important component of normal responses to infection
and injury. However, chronic activation of the immune system, due to
aberrant responses to normal stimuli, can lead to the establishment of a
persistent inflammatory state. Such inflammatory conditions are often
debilitating, and are associated with a number of important
co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease. Resting
non-proliferative tissues have distinctive metabolic activities and
requirements, which differ considerably from those in infiltrating
immune cells, which are undergoing proliferation and differentiation.
Immune responses in tissues may therefore be modulated by the relative
abundance of substrates in the inflamed site. In turn immune cell
activity can feed back and affect metabolic behaviour of the tissues, as
most clearly demonstrated in cachexia - the loss of cellular mass driven
by tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) a key mediator of the
inflammatory response. Here we discuss the potential for metabolomic
analysis to clarify the interactions between inflammation and metabolic
changes underlying many diseases. We suggest that an increased
understanding of the interaction between inflammation and cellular
metabolism, energy substrate use, tissue breakdown markers, the
microbiome and drug metabolites, may provide novel insight into the
regulation of inflammatory diseases.
