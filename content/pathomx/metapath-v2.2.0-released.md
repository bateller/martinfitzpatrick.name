This latest version adds a number of important features over the previous releases:

* A new name &mdash; Pathomx &mdash; reflecting pathway-centered analysis of multi-omics data

I have been busy adding [demos, walkthroughs and sample datasets][metapath-demos] since the last release. A set of default/demo workflows is also being constructed allowing simpler setup for processing multiple types of data. More information is also available on the [website][pathomx], and latests versions of Pathomx are available from the [downloads page][all-downloads]. Feedback and [bug-reports](https://github.com/pathomx/pathomx/issues) are always welcome.
