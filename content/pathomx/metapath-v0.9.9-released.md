An up-to-date build of MetaPath for Mac OS X is [available for download](http://download.pathomx.org/Pathomx-latest.dmg) today. This is the first public build supporting the interactive workflow, automated processing, NMR spectra processing, gene expression analysis, PCA, PLS-DA, and the rest.

Builds supporting Windows/Linux are on their way following migration to Python 3 for PyQt5 support on those platforms.
