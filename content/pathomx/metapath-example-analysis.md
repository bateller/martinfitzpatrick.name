Tags: metapath,software,metabolomics,python,matlab

Short demo of an experimental analysis of metabolomic (NMR) data using MetaPath. Metabolomic test dataset produced from THP-1 cells grown under normal and hypoxic conditions. Spectra (2D 1H JRES) have been pre-processed and quantified using the [BML-NMR](http://bml-nmr.org) service.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

The video shows an example analysis from processed data through to metabolic pathways and PLS-DA outputs.
