`Pathomx <http://pathomx.org>`_ is a workflow-based data analysis tool built on IPython. It
began as a metabolomic-analysis toolkit, but has extended to support general data analysis
workflows. It aims to be simple to use for non-experts while powerful enough for complex
analysis tasks. Key to both of these goals is the ability to create 'custom tools' that
can be drag-dropped together to form larger workflows.

Previously custom tool creation required a developer installation, however with the release 
of  v3(.0.2) you can now create custom tools using just the standard release. To get an
idea of what you can do with Pathomx you can `download it here <http://pathomx.org>`_ and 
follow on this brief tutorial on creating custom tools.

The custom tool we'll be creating is a 'Gremlin': a mischievous destroyer of data. You 
probably won't want to use this in your analysis, but it gives a good overview of 
what is possible.

The tool stub
-------------

All tools follow a basic structure we're going to call the *tool stub*. To get started on 
custom tool, simply download the `tool stub`_ to your local machine. Unzip the file
somewhere convenient, preferably in a specific folder for custom Pathomx tools. You should
end up with the following folder structure:

\<root>
   - .pathomx-plugin
   - __init__.py
   - loader.py
   - stub.py
   - stub.md
   - icon.png

A brief description of each follows - 

``.pathomx-plugin`` indicates that this folder is a Pathomx plugin folder. It also holds some
metadata about the plugin in the `Yapsy`_ plugin format. However, you don't need to know about 
that to use it just make your changes to the example provided.

``__init__.py`` is an empty file required by Python to import the folder as a module. Leave empty.

``loader.py`` contains the code required to initialise the plugin and start up. You can also
define config panels, dialogs and custom views (figure plots, etc.) in this file. 

``stub.py`` contains the actual code for the tool that will run on the IPython kernel. 
``stub.md`` contains the descriptive text in `Markdown`_ format.

``icon.png`` is the default icon for all tools in this plugin. You can add other icons and define them
specifically on a per-tool basis if you require.

You can have more than one tool per plugin using the same loader to initialise them all. 
This is useful when you have a number of tools that are conceptually related. This is 
seen in the standard 'Spectra' toolkit that offers a number of tools for dealing with frequency data.

Customising the stub
--------------------

To create your custom tool start with the stub file and customise from there. For this demo we'll
create a custom tool that randomly reorders and drops data on each iteration. We'll call
it 'Gremlin'.

Open up the ``.pathomx-plugin`` file and edit the metadata. The only line 
you have to edit is ``Name`` but feel free to edit the other data to match.
Do not change the ``Module`` line as this is needed to load the tool. Next 
rename ``stub.md`` and ``stub.py`` to `gremlin.md` and ``gremlin.py`` 
respectively. Then open up ``loader.py`` in a suitable text editor. We're
going to add some features to the Gremlin tool to show how it is done.

In the ``loader.py`` file you will find the following:

.. code-block:: python

    class StubTool(GenericTool):
        name = "Stub"
        shortname = 'stub'

        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super(StubTool, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

            self.config.set_defaults({
            })

            self.data.add_input('input_data')  # Add input slot
            self.data.add_output('output_data')  # Add output slot

    class Stub(ProcessingPlugin):

        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super(Stub, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self.register_tool_launcher(StubTool)


There are two parts to the tool. The ``StubTool`` class that defines the tool
and configures set up, etc. and the ``Stub`` loader which handles 
registration of the launcher for creating new instances of the tool. You
can define as many tools in this file as you want (give them unique names)
and register them in the same Stub class __init__.

The name of the tool is defined by the ``name`` parameter to the tool definition.
If none is supplied the tool will take the name of the plugin by default.
The ``shortname`` defines the name of the files that source code and information
text are loaded from e.g. ``stub.py`` and ``stub.md``. So change the ``shortname`` value
to *gremlin* and the ``name`` to *Gremlin*.

Below is this is the default config definition. Here you can set default
values for any configuration parameters using standard Python dictionary syntax. 
We'll add a parameter ``evilness`` that defines how much damage the gremlin
does to your data, and ``gremlin_type`` that defines what it does. Edit the `self.config` definition to:

.. code-block:: python

            self.config.set_defaults({
            'gremlin_type': 1,
            'evilness': 1,
            })

We've defined the parameters and given them both a default value of 1. These will
now be available from within the run kernel as `config['evilness']` and 
`config['gremlin_type']`.

Below the config definition there are two lines defining the input and output ports
of the tool respectively. You can name them anything you like as long as 
you follow standard Python variable naming conventions. Data will be passed
into the run kernel using these names. They are defined as `input_data` and 
`output_data` by default and that is enough for our gremlin tool. 

How to train your Gremlin
-------------------------

The runnable source code for tools is stored in a file named `<shortname>.py` in
standard Python script style. We've already renamed `stub.py` to `gremlin.py`
so you can open that now. In it you'll find:

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import scipy as sp

    # This is your stub source file. Add your code here!

That does not a lot. The first three lines simply import a set of standard
libraries for working with data: `Pandas`_, `NumPy`_ and `SciPy`_. You might
not need them all but it's worth keeping them available for now. To start
our custom tool we need to add some code to mess up the data. First we need
a copy of the input_data to output, then we want to mess it up. Add the 
following code to the file:

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import scipy as sp

    # This is your stub source file. Add your code here!

    from random import randint, choice

    # Define the gremlin types, these must be matched in the
    # loader config definition
    GREMLIN_RANDOM = 1
    GREMLIN_DELETE_ROW = 2
    GREMLIN_DELETE_COLUMN = 3
    GREMLIN_RANDOM_ROWS = 4
    GREMLIN_RANDOM_COLUMNS = 5

    output_data = input_data

    # Repeat the gremlin action 'evilness' times
    for n in range( config['evilness'] ):

        if config['gremlin_type'] == GREMLIN_RANDOM:
            gremlin_type = randint(1,5)
        else:
            gremlin_type = config['gremlin_type']
    
        if gremlin_type == GREMLIN_DELETE_ROW:
            # Delete random row(s) in the pandas dataframe
            output_data.drop( choice( output_data.columns ), axis=1, inplace=True )
        
        elif gremlin_type == GREMLIN_DELETE_COLUMN:
            # Delete random column(s) in the pandas dataframe
            output_data.drop( choice( output_data.index ), inplace=True )
        
        elif gremlin_type == GREMLIN_RANDOM_ROWS:
            # Randomly switch two rows' data
            if output_data.shape[0] < 2:
                raise Exception('Need at least 2 rows of data to switch')
            
            i1 = randint(0, output_data.shape[0]-1)
            i2 = randint(0, output_data.shape[0]-1)

            output_data.iloc[i1,:], output_data.iloc[i2,:] = output_data.iloc[i2,:], output_data.iloc[i1,:]
        

        elif gremlin_type == GREMLIN_RANDOM_COLUMNS:
            # Randomly switch two columns' data
            if output_data.shape[0] < 2:
                raise Exception('Need at least 2 columns of data to switch')

            i1 = randint(0, output_data.shape[0]-1)
            i2 = randint(0, output_data.shape[1]-1)
    
            output_data.iloc[:,i1], output_data.iloc[:,i2] = output_data.iloc[:,i2], output_data.iloc[:,i1]
    

    # Generate simple result figure (using pathomx libs)
    from pathomx.figures import spectra

    View = spectra(output_data, styles=styles);


This is the main guts of our gremlin. A copy of the `input_data` is made to `output_data`
and then a simple loop iterates `evilness` times while performing 
some or other task on the `output_data`. The choice of actions are: delete row,
delete column, switch two rows, switch two columns. An option is available to make a 
random selection from these transformations. Setting `evilness` to 10 and `gremlin_type` 
to 1 will perform 100 random operations on the data. Enough to drive anyone quite mad.

Finally, we use built in standard figure plotting tools to output a view of the transformed data.

Initial test
------------

To see what damage the gremlin can do we need a set of data to work with. Download the
`sample dataset`_, a set of processed 2D JRES NMR data with class assignments already applied.

Start up Pathomx as normal. Before we can use our Gremlin tool we'll need to tell Pathomx
where to find it so it can be loaded. On the main toolbar select "Plugins" then "Manage plugins..."
to get to the plugin management view. Here you can activate and deactivate different plugins
and add/remove them from the Toolkit view. To find the Gremlin tool we'll need to tell Pathomx
about the folder it is in. 

Add the folder containing the Gremlin tool, or alternatively a parent folder if you want to create
more tools in the same place. Pathomx will automatically search through the entire tree
to find plugins so it's probably best not to add an entire drive. 

Once added the plugin list will refresh and be listed (and automatically activated) in the plugin list.
You can now close the plugin management list and see that your new tool is ready and waiting in 
the Toolkit viewer. It will be there every time you run Pathomx.

Drag it into the workspace and click on it. You'll notice that there isn't much to see: there is
no configuration UI defined and we haven't updated the about text. But it's still a fully-operational
gremlin. So let's see it in action.

Drag an *Import Text/CSV* tool into the workspace and select it. Using the open file widget
select the file you downloaded earlier containing the demo dataset. Have a look at the Spectra 
view output to see how it *should* look.

Now drag from the *Import Text/CSV* ``output_data` port to the Gremlin ``input_data`` port.
The gremlin tool will automatically calculate using the new data and display a modified plot
called 'View'. If you can't see the different between this and the earlier plot try pressing
the green *play* button a few times to re-run the tool. You will see the data change each
time.

Adding configuration
--------------------

A tool is not a lot of use without the ability to control it. All tools can be modified by editing 
the source directly (see the *#* tab) but that isn't particular convenient. Pathomx tools
can define configuration panels, containing multiple widgets that are linked to the defined config settings.

Add the following code to the ``loader.py`` file.

.. code-block:: python

    # Configuration settings for the Gremlin
    class GremlinConfigPanel(ConfigPanel):

        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super(GremlinConfigPanel, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

            gd = QGridLayout()

            choices = {
                'Random': 1,
                'Delete row': 2,
                'Delete column': 3,
                'Randomise rows': 4,
                'Randomise columns': 5,
            }

            gremlin_type_cb = QComboBox()
            gremlin_type_cb.addItems( choices.keys() )
            self.config.add_handler('gremlin_type', gremlin_type_cb, choices)
            gd.addWidget( QLabel('Gremlin type'), 0, 0)
            gd.addWidget(gremlin_type_cb, 0, 1)

            evilness_sb = QSpinBox()
            self.config.add_handler('evilness', evilness_sb)
            gd.addWidget( QLabel('Evilness'), 1, 0)
            gd.addWidget(evilness_sb, 1, 1)

            self.layout.addLayout(gd)

            self.finalise()


This block of code defines the configuration panel for the tool. This is done using standard
Qt (PyQt) widgets and layout code, which won't be gone into detail here. However, the bits
unique to Pathomx tool code are worth a bit of explanation:

As previously described tools have an in-built config handler (based on the `pyqtconfig` package
available on PyPi). This keeps track of settings and also allows widgets to be attached and
automatically synced with configuration settings. This is achieved with `self.config.add_handler` linee.
The first parameter is the config key to set, the second the widget and the (optional) third is a
mapping dictionary/lambda tuple that converts between the displayed and stored value.

This is used for the drop-down so that when *Random* is displayed, the stored value in 
the config is actually ``1``. These mappings can be applied to any widget and can apply any transformation
required. The widget is synced to the config value as it is bound.

Each ``ConfigPanel`` has a default ``layout`` object defined to which
your widgets are attached. They can be placed directly using `self.layout.addWidget(widget)`
or, as above, by defining a new layout and assigning that. It's usually useful to use a ``GridLayout``
to place widgets on the panel alongside labels.

Finally, the `self.finalise()` call is required to apply the layouts and wrap up the initialisation.

Next, add the following line to the ``__init__`` function of the GremlinTool class:

.. code-block:: python

        self.addConfigPanel(GremlinConfigPanel, 'Settings')


...and you're good to go. Restart Pathomx and the Gremlin tool will auto-reload automatically.
Drag the tool into the workspace and then select it. On the left hand side you should see 
your shiny new control panel. Connect the tool up with the sample data as before, and then
experiment with the config settings to see the effect. 

.. image:: /images/software/pathomx/gremlin_tool_control_panel_3_0_0.png
    :alt: The control panel as visible in the Pathomx application


Since we output the result of the transformation via the ``output_data`` port you can also
connect up other tools and see the effect there. For example, connect up a PCA or PLS-DA
tool and see the effect that the gremlin has on the ability of those algorithms to 
separate the two classes in the dataset.

The polish
----------

Open up the ``gremlin.md`` file and edit the file to say whatever you would like it to. You can
also replace the ``icon.png`` with a PNG format image more appropriate to an evil gremlin tool.

The end
-------

This doesn't cover everything that is possible within a custom tool, but it should give
you enough to get started on your own. If you're interested in creating your own custom
tools or contributing to Pathomx in any other way get in touch!
