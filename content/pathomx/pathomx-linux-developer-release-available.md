Slug: pathomx-linux-developer-release

Github: pathomx/pathomx

A developer release of [Pathomx][pathomx] (Python3) is now available. This release can be installed
by using the `./developer_release_linux_python3.sh` script from the cloned [Github repository][pathomx-github].
This script installs all dependencies (via `apt-get` and `pip`) that are required for 
Pathomx to run.

This developer release is an important first step to getting Pathomx successfully packaged
for Linux. Any contributions, comments and feedback most welcome.

Hope you've had a great Christmas and New Year.
