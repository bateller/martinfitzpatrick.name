Create Simple GUI Applications will show you how to use Python and Qt to do just that!

If you want to learn how to write GUI applications it can be pretty tricky to get started. 
There are a lot of new concepts you need to understand to get *anything* to work. A lot of 
tutorials offer nothing but screencasts, or short code snippets without any explanation of 
the underlying systems and how they work together. But, like any code, writing GUI
applications requires you to learn to think about the problem in the right way.

In this book I will give you the real useful basics that you need to get building functional 
applications with the PyQt framework.  I’ll include explanations, diagrams, walkthroughs and 
code to make sure you know what you’re doing every step of the way. 

In no time at all you will have a fully functional Qt application - ready to customise as 
you like.

So, lets get started!
