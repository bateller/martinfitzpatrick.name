*Create Simple GUI Applications* will show you how to use Python and Qt to do just that.

This ebook was written to accompany [the video tutorial course on Udemy](http://martinfitzpatrick.name/article/create-simple-gui-applications-with-python-and-qt/),
adding background and detail to the lectures, with more examples and reference documentation. However, it stands perfectly well alone 
as a solid introduction to programming Python GUI applications using the PyQt framework.
The first chapter covers all that you need to quickly start building functional 
applications.

This is my first ebook, and first time publishing on the Leanpub platform - which is designed for
*in progress* publishing. The book will continue to be extended with more material as the course expands, 
and these updates will remain free to everyone who has previously bought the book.

A web version of the book is [available to read online for free](https://leanpub.com/create-simple-gui-applications).

Hope you find the book useful, and let me know what you think!
