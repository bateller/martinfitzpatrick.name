*Create Simple GUI Applications* will show you how to use Python and Qt to do just that.

This new ebook was written to accompany [the video tutorial course on Udemy](http://martinfitzpatrick.name/article/create-simple-gui-applications-with-python-and-qt/).
and adds background and detail to the lectures, with more examples and reference documentation.
It gives you the important basics that you need to get quickly start building functional 
applications with the PyQt framework. 

This is my first ebook, and first time publishing on the Leanpub platform - which is designed for
*in progress* publishing. The book will continue to be extended with more material, which will
be available free to everyone who has previously bought the book.

A web version of the book is [available to read online for free](https://leanpub.com/create-simple-gui-applications/read).

Hope you find the book useful, and let me know what you think!
