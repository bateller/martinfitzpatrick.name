An up-to-date build of MetaPath for Mac OS X is [available for download](http://download.martinfitzpatrick.name/MetaPath-0.9.9.dmg) today. This is the first public build supporting the interactive workflow, automated processing, NMR spectra processing, gene expression analysis, PCA, PLS-DA, and the rest.

Builds supporting Windows/Linux are on their way following migration to Python 3 for PyQt5 support on those platforms.

Feedback and [bug-reports](https://github.com/mfitzp/metapath/issues) are more than welcome.
