At a new shell prompt (bash or Terminal.app on Mac) press `Ctrl-R`

Start typing the search string to lookup in your bash history. As you type the top matching command in your history will appear.

Hit `Return` to accept the search and execute the matching command or `Esc` to cancel the search.

>You can also hit the right-arrow to edit the command before running it.
