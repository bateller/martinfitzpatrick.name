A quick one-liner to recursively search files for a given text string.


Open up a terminal session and enter the following - replacing `"foo"` with the text to search for. 



    :::sh

    find . -exec grep -l "foo" {} \;









You can also limit the search to files with a particular extension (e.g. HTML or CSS). The first form will only return files in the current directory



    :::sh

    find *.html -exec grep -l "foo" {} \;



Alternatively you can search recursively while matching filenames using the `-name` parameter:



    :::sh

    find . -name *.html -exec grep -l "foo" {} \;




>You can pass other options to find including for example `-mtime -1` to specify only files modified within the past day.  


You can also replace `.` with the name of any other folder to search:



    :::sh

    find /var/www -name *.html -exec grep -l "foo" {} \;



This will search `/var/www` recursively for files named `*.html` and containing `foo`.
