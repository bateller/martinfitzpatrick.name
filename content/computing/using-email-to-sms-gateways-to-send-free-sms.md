Many mobile telephone companies provide allow sending of SMS messages to handsets by email, although most do not publicise this capability. Any email sent to these specially formatted email addresses are forwarded directly to your mobile device. In effect this service gives you free SMS messaging from PC to mobile phone. This can be useful for monitoring long running processes to notify a mobile device on completion.

#Method

[Find your provider in this list](http://martinfitzpatrick.name/list-of-email-to-sms-gateways).  Replace the **number** with your own mobile number, adding additional prepended numbers if neccessary.

Send a test message to the email address. You should either receive the email as an SMS or a delivery failure report from the mobile provider.

>Make the message short and avoid adding signatures etc. to the outgoing email or you will receive multiple useless messages.

>

>Some providers require activation before allowing this service to avoid spam.

>

>Standard customer service operators often have no knowledge of the service so you may need to ask to speak to the helpdesk/tech staff - however perserverance and you will usually get the information you need, or at least a confirmed "No."


If you receive a failure report try various combinations of the phone number formatting (ommitting zeros, international format, etc.) to see if *any* work.



If it is not working, try contacting your provider to see if there are any additional activation steps required and for help on appropriate formatting for the number/email address. 


>If you receive updated information from the provider please drop a note in the comments below and we'll update our listing.
