Initialize a Git repository from a local directory, and the files therein, pushing it to an existing but empty remote.

>Assumes that the remote bare repository has been created.


#Requirements
Git

An empty bare remote repository

#Method

Open a terminal/console (Terminal on Mac/Linux, cmd.exe on Windows) and cd to the directory that will be added to Git.



Initialize the directory as an empty Git repository using the following command:



`git init`



Add the contents of the directory to the repo:



`git stage .`



`git commit -m "Initial commit."`


>Alternatively add only some of the files by staging only those of interest and perhaps '.gitignore'ing the rest.


Add the remote, replacing {remote} with the URI for the remote repository (for example, ssh://git.example.com/myrepo.git):



`git remote add origin {remote}`



Push the commit to the remote:



`git push -u origin master`




>-u adds a tracking reference for the branch which is useful for argument-less pullÂ commands amongst others.
